# Feature Review 0001 — Back button on Event Detail + Bottom Nav restructure

## Summary
✅ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE** - The feature has been implemented correctly according to the plan.

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ Routing & Navigation Structure
- **Routes correctly restructured**: `/app/map` now serves as container with nested routes for `list` and `calendar`
- **Navigation updated to 4 items**: Map, Submit, Conferences, Settings (List tab removed as planned)
- **Nested routing implemented**: Uses `<Outlet/>` pattern correctly in MapView

### ✅ EventDetail Back Button
- **Back button properly implemented**: Uses `window.history.length > 1` check with `/app/map` fallback
- **Correct positioning**: Placed in header area with secondary button styling
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper `aria-label="Back"`
- **Navigation logic**: Handles both history-based navigation and direct links

### ✅ Calendar View Implementation
- **Read-only calendar created**: Groups events by day with proper date formatting
- **Data filtering**: Correctly filters for upcoming events (`endUTC >= now`)
- **Grouping algorithm**: Uses local date keys for day-based grouping
- **Time formatting**: Proper localization using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- **UI consistency**: Uses card-based layout matching other views

### ✅ Embed Support
- **Calendar view supported**: `EmbedView` accepts `view=calendar` parameter
- **Correct URL generation**: Generates proper links to nested calendar route
- **Parameter handling**: Maintains existing `committee` and `range` parameters

### ✅ Manifest Updates
- **Shortcuts updated**: Consolidated browsing under single "Browse" shortcut pointing to `/app/map`
- **Removed separate List shortcut**: As planned

## Code Quality Assessment

### ✅ TypeScript Usage
- Proper type definitions for calendar items
- Consistent data structures across components

### ✅ Style Consistency
- All components use established CSS classes (`card`, `btn`, `badge`, etc.)
- Segmented control styles properly implemented
- No style inconsistencies found

### ✅ Performance Considerations
- CalendarView uses `useMemo` for grouping optimization
- No unnecessary re-renders identified

## Minor Observations
- **Demo data structure**: Uses slightly different field names than production will use, but properly documented with TODO comments
- **Firestore integration**: Ready for implementation (query structure documented in comments)

## Recommendations
None - implementation is solid and follows the plan exactly.

## Testing Notes
- Build passes without errors
- All routes properly configured
- Navigation flow works as expected
- Back button handles edge cases correctly

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - Feature implemented precisely according to specification.
