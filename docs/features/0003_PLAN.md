# Darken Map Text Color

## Brief Description
The cluster count text in Mapbox items is displaying too dim with light gray color `#7dd3fc` on white/light backgrounds, making it hard to read. Need to darken the text color for better visibility and contrast.

## Files to Modify

### `src/routes/MapHome.tsx`
- **Line 70**: Update the `text-color` property in the `cluster-count` layer from `'#7dd3fc'` to a darker shade
- **Lines 106-107**: Review popup HTML content styling to ensure text contrast is adequate
- **Layer definitions**: 
  - `cluster-count` layer (lines 60-72): Controls the text color for cluster count numbers
  - Popup content generation (line 106): HTML content that may contain links and text

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses Mapbox GL JS layers with the following text styling:
- Cluster count text uses `text-color: '#7dd3fc'` (light blue/cyan)
- Text size is set to 12px
- Popups are generated with custom HTML containing links styled with `.btn` class

## Required Changes

1. **Update cluster text color**: Change `'text-color': '#7dd3fc'` to a darker color value that provides better contrast against the map background
2. **Verify popup text contrast**: Ensure any text in map popups has adequate contrast
3. **Test across different map zoom levels**: Verify text remains readable at various zoom levels where clusters appear

## Testing Considerations
- Verify text readability across different map backgrounds
- Test cluster text visibility at various zoom levels
- Ensure popup text maintains adequate contrast
- Check text appearance on different devices/screens
